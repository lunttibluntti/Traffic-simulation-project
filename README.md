# Traffic-simulation-project

This simulation was made for Aalto University's advanced Python course in the computer science minor.

Everything is made from scratch including the GUI and the use of external libraries such as game.py was not allowed.

There is still some individual cases where vehicle's stop unexpectedly, but the simulation mostly works.

Simulation runs as a turn based implementation and the steering behaviour is made for this use case specifically.
